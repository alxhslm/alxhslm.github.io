With all of the recent hype around generative AI, also thought it would be interesting to use some form of generative model. The source code is available on GitHub.\nalxhslm/hand-writing-generation A GenAI app to generate hand-written characters Jupyter Notebook 0 0 Objective # The aim of this project is to:\nTrain a model to classify hand-written alphanumeric characters Generate synthetic hand-written characters using the same model I decided to use a Variational autoencoder since it is one of the few widely used models uniting deep learning and Bayesian methods.\nInteractive dashboard # In order to get a better feel for how the model works, and its stengths and weaknesses, I created a Streamlit dashboard (which you can access here to have a go yourself).\nThis dashboard goes through the following steps:\nYou being by drawing a few characters which gives us some observations \\(x_t\\) This allows the encoder to produce an estimate of the posterior distribution \\(p(z|x_{t})\\), which effectively allows the model to “learn” your writing style. You can then generate arbitrary hand-written characters by sampling the distribution \\(p(x) = p(x|z)p(z)\\) where \\(p(z)=p(z|x_{t})\\). By varying how you draw, you can change the style of characters which the model produces. Here are some examples of the sort of hand-written characters the model can synthesise:\nDescription Generated images Narrow Wide Light Bold Italic ","date":"1 December 2023","permalink":"/projects/hand-writing-generation/","section":"Projects","summary":"This was a more advanced project to gain more practical experience with deep learning with unstructured data.","title":"Hand Writing Generation"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2023","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"This was my first personal ML project.
