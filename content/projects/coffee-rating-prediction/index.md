This was the first complete ML project I completed purely for myself. The goal was to familiarise myself with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I enjoy drinking nice coffee, so I chose a topic which I hoped would help me buy better coffee in the future :coffee:.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to be able to predict how highly rated a coffee would be on [CoffeeReview.com](http://CoffeeReview.com) based purely on information about the coffee such:
- Origin
- Roaster
- Price 
- ....

## Interactive dashboard
Have a play with the Streamlit dashboard [here](https://coffee-rating-prediction.streamlit.app/) and see how your favourite coffee fares.
