This was a personal ML project, and the goal was to familiarise myself with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I enjoy drinking nice coffee, so I chose a topic which I hoped would help me buy better coffee in the future. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alxhslm/coffee-rating-prediction) and you can access the hosted Streamlit dashboard [here](https://coffee-rating-prediction.streamlit.app/).
