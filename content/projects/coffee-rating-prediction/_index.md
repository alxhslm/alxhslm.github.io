This was my first personal ML project. The goal was to familiarise myself with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I enjoy drinking nice coffee, so I chose a topic which I hoped would help me buy better coffee in the future. The source code is available on GitHub.
