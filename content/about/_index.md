I'm an engineer based in London, with experience from F1 and agtech, as well as a PhD in engineering. I'm highly skilled in building optimisation and machine learning models in Python. I have a passion for innovation and a strong attention to detail. I enjoy coming up with elegant solutions to challenging real-world problems.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy [running and cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/alex_haslam). I also like to try new [craft beers](https://untappd.com/user/alexharryh) and speciality coffees.
