I’ve been using a Logitech MX Keys for a while now, and while it’s a solid keyboard, it’s a bit on the large side. I wanted something more compact, with a better typing experience—so I started looking into mechanical keyboards.

## What I Wanted in a Keyboard

I had a few key requirements for my next keyboard:

- **Wireless** – I like a clean desk setup with minimal cables. Plus, having the option to use it with an iPad in the future is a nice bonus.
- **TKL or 75% Layout** – I prefer a more compact design so I have more space for my mouse.
- **Function Keys** – I use these a lot, especially for IDE shortcuts, so they were a must-have.
- **Tactile Switches** – This keyboard is for typing, not gaming. I wanted something that felt great to type on.
- **UK ISO Layout** – I don’t like switching between layouts, and since my MacBook uses ISO, I wanted my external keyboard to match.
- **Mac Keycaps** – I pretty much exclusively use Macs now, so I didn’t want Windows key labels.
- **Professional Look** – Nothing too flashy or “gamer-y.” Just a clean, smart design.

## Why I Chose the Keychron V1 Max

Keychron is one of the few manufacturers that actually make ISO layout mechanical keyboards, so they were the obvious brand to look at. Initially, I considered the K2 Pro, but then I came across the V1 Max. It was widely recommended as one of the best budget options and seemed to punch well above its price point.

It brings in features from Keychron’s higher-end Q1 Pro, which made it even more appealing:

- **Volume knob** – Adjusting volume with dedicated keys takes too long, so this was a great addition.
- **2.4GHz Wireless** – Bluetooth can be unreliable, so having a more stable wireless option was a big plus.
- **VIA & Keychron Launcher Support** – This meant I could easily remap keys to suit my needs.

## A great typing experience

The Banana Switches on this keyboard are excellent. They offer great tactility with a satisfying “thock,” but they’re not overly loud, making them a significant improvement over the Browns I’ve used before.

The overall build quality is impressive. Despite being plastic, it looks and feels far more expensive than it actually is. One nice touch is that all the screws are hidden on the bottom, unlike the regular V1, which contributes to a cleaner design.

The wireless connection has been reliable, pairing quickly over Bluetooth and maintaining a stable connection. My old 2015 MacBook Pro struggled with connectivity, but I suspect that’s more down to the laptop than the keyboard itself.

Battery life is another strong point. It lasts a long time between charges, and macOS allows you to check the battery level easily.

I wasn’t particularly interested in backlighting, but I have to admit it looks good. The RGB isn’t something I’d have sought out, but it adds a nice touch to the overall aesthetic.

## Terrible customer service

Before buying, I saw a lot of Reddit posts complaining about Keychron’s poor customer service. Many people recommended buying from a big reseller to make returns easier. I didn’t take this too seriously—I figured the risk of a keyboard arriving faulty was low, and I got a discount from Keychron directly, making it much cheaper than elsewhere.

Well, lesson learned.

The keyboard arrived **non-functional**. It wouldn’t hold a charge and only worked when plugged in. On top of that, the keys weren’t mapped correctly—it was stuck in Windows mode, with Command and Option swapped.

I tried updating the firmware via Keychron Launcher, but that didn’t help. I emailed Keychron… and got no reply.

After doing some research, I found that loose cables inside the keyboard were a common issue. I opened mine up and saw the ribbon connector was actually broken, meaning the ribbon cable wouldn’t stay in place. I assumed I’d need a new PCB and waited to hear back from Keychron.

A week passed, and I still hadn’t heard anything, so I got frustrated and decided to fix it myself. A bit of electrical tape and glue later, the ribbon was secured. I added extra tape to prevent future issues, put everything back together, and—finally—the keyboard was working perfectly.

Thankfully, it’s a product designed to be opened up, so it was a relatively easy fix. But I really shouldn’t have had to do this.

## Final Thoughts

Despite the issues, I’d still **recommend the Keychron V1 Max**—because it’s genuinely a great keyboard. However, it’s clear that Keychron has serious **quality control and customer service problems**. If you’re going to buy one, do yourself a favour and order from a reputable retailer, even if it costs a little more. It’ll likely arrive quicker, and you’ll have an easier time if anything goes wrong.

The only danger now is that I’ve caught the **mechanical keyboard bug**. I’m already eyeing up an upgrade to something with a metal build… Not a cheap hobby!
