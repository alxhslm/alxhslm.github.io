## Why I Joined F45

I recently joined F45 to lose some weight and force myself to do more weight training. I generally prefer running or cycling outside, so this seemed like a good way to mix things up.

F45 promotes its **LionHeart** heart rate monitor, which connects to a receiver in the studio and provides:

- Live heart rate data displayed on screens during the class
- Calories burned and LionHeart points (whatever those are)

Since I already use a Garmin Forerunner running watch, I wasn‚Äôt interested in paying extra for a proprietary device that offers minimal added benefit. However, I soon realised there was more to the system than I initially thought.

### The Strava Sync Let-down

F45 allows you to [link your account to Strava](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/27745923005837-F45-and-Strava), automatically posting your workout along with the type of class it was. In theory, this should provide a more accurate calorie estimate because F45 knows what you did in class.

After linking my F45 account, I went to my first session expecting my heart rate data to sync to Strava. But when I checked the activity later - nothing. No HR data. üò¢

### The Reddit Discovery: ANT+ Compatibility

A quick Google search revealed that LionHeart data is supposed to sync to Strava. Meaning, if I had a LionHeart monitor, my heart rate and calorie data would show up.

Digging deeper, I found a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/f45/comments/1ceuypa/comment/l1l2zbu/) that revealed an interesting detail: **LionHeart just uses ANT+**. That means any ANT+ heart rate monitor - like my Garmin Dual HRM chest strap or my Garmin watch - should work. üéâ

## Setting Up My Garmin HRM With F45

I chose to use my Garmin HRM over my running watch as it is typically more accurate, especially when you‚Äôre moving your arms a lot like you do at F45.

F45 requires you to enter a **Device ID** in the app to link your heart rate monitor, which corresponds to the **ANT+ Sensor ID**. To find the Sensor ID of my Garmin HRM, I checked my Garmin Edge 530 which was already paired to it, which reported a value of `863436`. I entered this into the F45 app and eagerly awaited my data appearing on the class screens.

Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work as expected. When I went to my next class, a device showed up on the screen as `Guest#11486` but wasn‚Äôt linked to my account. ü§î

### The ‚ÄúMagic Number‚Äù Problem

Another [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/f45/comments/jw9vhl/comment/gd1mhu2/) mentioned a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù that needed to be entered instead. This corresponds to the number after `Guest#`. But where did this number come from?

The issue stems from how [ANT+ assigns device addresses](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/317491/ant-device-numbers). Originally, ANT+ used **16-bit addresses**, but newer devices use **20-bit addresses**. Some systems (including F45) still expect a 16-bit number, meaning we need to convert our 20-bit Sensor ID to its 16-bit equivalent.

### Converting an ANT+ Sensor ID for F45

To calculate the correct Device ID for F45:

1. Convert the number from your Garmin device to **Hexadecimal**. **Example:** `863436` ‚Üí `0xD2CCC`
2. Drop the first 4 bits (the first hexadecimal character). **Example:** `0xD2CCC` ‚Üí `0x2CCC`
3. Convert back to **Decimal**.**Example:** `0x2CCC` ‚Üí `11486`

Once I entered `11486` into the F45 app, my Garmin HRM was recognised when I to my next class, and my heart rate data was displayed correctly on the screens. üéØ

## Final Thoughts

It‚Äôs always satisfying to figure out _why_ something works rather than just following a vague fix. If you already own an ANT+ heart rate monitor, there‚Äôs no need to buy an F45 LionHeart ‚Äî you can simply use this method to get it working.

Hopefully, this helps others looking to use their own devices with F45!
